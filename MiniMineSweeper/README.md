# Minesweeper Game Console Application 
## Overview This project is a console-based Minesweeper-style game where the player navigates from one side of a chessboard grid to the other while avoiding hidden mines. The player has a number of lives and loses one each time a mine is hit. The final score is the number of moves taken to reach the other side of the board.
## Features 
- 8x8 grid (chessboard) 
- Random placement of mines 
- Player movement (up, down, left, right) 
- Display of current position in chess notation (e.g., C2) 
- Tracking of lives and moves 
- Repository Design Pattern for clean coding and separation of concerns
